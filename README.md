# Some Weird Python Shit

[Monkeytype](https://github.com/Instagram/MonkeyType) is actually quite clean.

```bash
Monkeytype stub dummy.ops
Monkeytype apply dummy.ops
```

## ASYNC Python
is also a cool thing

## Check out FastAPI
Alternative to your flask travails lol

Comparison
----------

For the index request, `flask` takes 6ms while `FastAPI` takes 4ms.
